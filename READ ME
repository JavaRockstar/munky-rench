#MUNKY RENCH
is the apk swiss army knife for linux. 

At this time, initial features are mapped in the script, but the script is not fully functional.

Features will include unzip, zip, decompile and recompile, signapk, adb commands and zipalign.
It will also be very noob friendly, with a tutorial feel

Future features may include kitchen functionality, other toolkit features, some optimization things, and possibly an install script
to verify and install java, git, apktool, signapk, etc etc...

The goal is to provide a single tool that does the job of as many as possible, while maintaining a user-friendly explanitory atmosphere that informs the inexperienced without getting in the way of the power users
