#MUNKY RENCH
is the apk swiss army knife for linux. It will also be as self-contained and noob friendly as possible.

At this time, all listed features function in testing, but I have not incorporated all the features that I have planned for this project. Features include unzip, zip, install frameworks, decompile and recompile, signapk, zipalign, and adb install.

Future features may include kitchen functionality, other toolkit features, some optimization things, flashable zip creation, and possibly an install script
to verify and install java, git, apktool, signapk, etc etc...

The goal is to provide a single tool that does the job of as many as possible, while maintaining a user-friendly explanitory atmosphere that informs the inexperienced without getting in the way of the power users.
